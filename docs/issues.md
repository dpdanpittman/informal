# Issue: DNS Server Unresponsive

**Description:** One possible issue that could occur is that one or more DNS server containers in the cluster become unresponsive, causing DNS resolution failures or degraded performance.

**Potential Cause:**

- Network connectivity issues
- Resource limitations on the host machine
- Configuration errors or conflicts within the DNS server containers
- Software bugs or compatibility issues

## Resolution Runbook:

1. **Verify Network Connectivity:**

- Check the network connectivity between the DNS server containers and other relevant components in the environment.
- Ensure that the containers can communicate with each other and external resources as needed.
- Troubleshoot any network-related issues that may be affecting the DNS server containers.

2. **Check Resource Utilization:**

- Review the resource utilization of the host machine where the DNS server containers are running.
- Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage to identify if any resource limitations are causing the unresponsiveness.
- Consider adjusting resource allocations or upgrading the host machine if necessary.

3. **Review Configuration Settings:**

- Validate the configuration settings within each DNS server container.
- Ensure that the container configurations, such as DNS zones, zone transfers, and intercommunication settings, are correct and consistent across the cluster.
- Look for any configuration errors or conflicts that may be impacting the DNS server's functionality.

4. **Restart or Recreate Unresponsive Containers:**

- If a DNS server container is unresponsive, try restarting the container to see if it resolves the issue.
- Use the following commands to restart a specific container:
```shell
docker restart <container_name>
```
Replace `<container_name>` with the actual name or ID of the unresponsive DNS server container.
- If restarting the container does not resolve the issue, consider recreating the container by stopping and removing it, and then starting a new instance:
```shell
docker stop <container_name>
docker rm <container_name>
docker-compose up -d <container_name>
```
Replace `<container_name>` with the name of the problematic DNS server container.

5. **Monitor and Investigate Logs:**

- Monitor the logs of the DNS server containers to identify any error messages or warnings.
- Analyze the logs for potential clues about the cause of the unresponsiveness.
- Use tools like docker logs or review log files within the containers to gather information for troubleshooting.

6. **Check for Software Updates or Bug Fixes:**

- Ensure that you are using the latest version of Trust-DNS and Docker.
- Check for any available software updates or bug fixes related to Trust-DNS that may address the issue.
- Update the Trust-DNS image or Docker versions if necessary to potentially resolve the problem.

7. **Seek Support or Consult Documentation:**

- If the issue persists or requires further investigation, consult the Trust-DNS documentation, official forums, or relevant community resources for assistance.
- Reach out to the Trust-DNS community or support channels to report the issue and seek guidance.

### Useful Commands

1. **Working with Docker Compose:**

- `docker-compose up -d`: Start the Docker Compose services defined in the docker-compose.yml file in detached mode.
- `docker-compose down`: Stop and remove the Docker Compose services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
- `docker-compose ps`: List the status of the Docker Compose services.

2. **Checking Logs and Container Status:**

- `docker logs <container_id_or_name>`: View the logs of a specific container.
- `docker-compose logs <service_name>`: View the logs of a specific service defined in the Docker Compose file.
- `docker ps`: List the running Docker containers.
- `docker-compose ps`: List the status of the Docker Compose services.

3. **Interacting with Containers:**

- `docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> <command>`: Execute a command interactively in a running container.
- `docker-compose exec <service_name> <command>`: Execute a command interactively in a specific service container defined in the Docker Compose file.

4. **Inspecting Containers and Images:**

- `docker inspect <container_id_or_name>`: Display detailed information about a container.
- `docker image inspect <image>`: Display detailed information about an image.

5. **Cleaning Up:**

- `docker-compose down -v`: Stop and remove the Docker Compose services and associated volumes.
- `docker system prune`: Remove all unused containers, networks, and images to free up disk space.
- `docker volume prune`: Remove unused Docker volumes.
