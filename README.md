# Informal Task 

## Setting up a DNS Server

_Disclaimer: Some of the basic setup instructions, such as creating a GPG key and setting up an instance on Vultr, were sourced from the web and slightly modified for the purposes of this documentation._

### Github Configuration

Some initial setup may be required to use PGP for signing commits. Below is a link to the steps I took to accomplish this:

1. [Github Configuration](docs/githubConfiguration.md)

### Build and Dockerize Application

Since this task involves building clusters that communicate with each other, I have chosen to set up cloud instances. I started with one instance initially and added the additional virtual machine (VM) towards the end of the project.

**Server Specs:**
```
Regular Performance Intel Cloud Compute Share vCPU
4 vCPU
8 gb RAM
160gb SSD
Ubuntu 22.04
```

2. [Setting up a cloud server](docs/setupCloudServer.md)

Next, we will proceed to build the application on our newly configured virtual machine (VM).

3. [Building the Application](docs/buildApp.md)
   
After completing the build using Cargo, we will want to transpose the application into a Docker image.

5. [Install Docker and Dockerize](docs/dockerInstall.md)

### Building the Cluster

Next, we will use an orchestration tool to launch multiple containers on localhost. For this task, I have chosen to use Docker Compose. By utilizing Docker Compose on localhost, we can efficiently manage and deploy the required containers for our application. Docker Compose simplifies the process of defining and running multi-container applications, allowing us to define the services, their configurations, and the communication between them in a declarative manner. This approach provides an efficient and scalable solution for our orchestration needs.

6. [Launch Multiple Containers](docs/containers.md)

The final step is to create a DNS cluster with the newly created containers.
